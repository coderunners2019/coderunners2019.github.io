Bananas were discovered in 327 B.C. when Alexander The Great and his
army invaded India. While he was carrying on the invasion, he
discovered banana crops in the Indian valleys. After tasting the exotic
and unusual fruit for the first time, he introduced the new discovery
to the Western world. By 200 AD, bananas had spread to China.<br>
Bananas could be striked by a disease known as Panama disease, which is
a disease that can only be found in soil. It poisons and kills the
bananas causing them to rot.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>
Bananas are used as hilarious and disgusting meme material in this
modern day and age.But think of it in a good way, because memes are
funny, so don't be one of those types of people.<br>
