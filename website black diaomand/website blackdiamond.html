an animation about polution in the ocean there was many fish going

in the ocean.<br>

The secound procject we did was about creating&nbsp; a robot that can stop
when the light touches red and we also had a race after completing all
of are question the race was so much fun but our team didn't win but
its ok because it not all about winning its about having fun and
learning.The thing <br>

that i thought was the hardest was building the robot because we had to
change up some things because the first time we messed up but we found
a way to fix it.<br>



The third project we did was making an educational video game for littel kids so they can learn things from our game . The <br>
