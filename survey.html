&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Next time, try to walk students through the
robotics part just like you did with scratch. Make sure they understand
and don't include very hard projects since some are just beginners.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I donâ&#8364;&#8482;t know because everything was cool'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'more presentations on projects'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Improving the experience of this camp is not really
needed. I really enjoyed my time here, but I didn't really get to enjoy
talking to new people. I am not really social, but I feel like the
experience you can try to improve on is making us watch more fun'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think you could like present more things on the
tv and the computer so they can actually see there creation on the big
sceen.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'More time for lunch.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I Dont think you need to improve anything !'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For making more snack time so you have breaks to
communicate about your story or your things that you have to do'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'this will be helpful when i am older '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am not sure how the experience can be improved, I have enjoyed this camp.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i don't know'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'you dont really have to change anything'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Explain the topic more.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Make only some of the days a competition if you want to.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Maybe give a take on how much they know about coding. I already know past java for instance.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'to have groups/tables interact with people not inside your group/table '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'a bit more explanation because its a bit complicated'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'to improve this experience for future students your
teaching them how do code because they can learn more about it and in
the future theres ganna be now things so they are telling us what is
happing and what we need to know so we can get ready for the fut'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i think your doing fine with that'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Honestly nothing eveything was good&nbsp; '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i really thimnk everyhting was greatI think&nbsp; this camp should continue doing what it does.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'no imorovment needed'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't think you need any improvements.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Make the location more accsesiable.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To teach kids how to code and how to create websites.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i think its good so far'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'do new or more stuff for them so they can learned
more for the future kids like make them learn aleast 3 things to do and
learned'<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Make robotics a little easier'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do more fun activities that provide moving more'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'this was well strucktured camp and i think that was perfect to bring chalenges for people'<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give us more times.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Remind students to bring a jacket.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'turn the air down a little'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'add abit about learning to programn using a computer language such as PYTHON OR ADAH'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'overall I had fun and the experience was fun but maybe move around the kids to get to know eachother. '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'nothing'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Learn to use a language like PYTHON&nbsp; '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give a laptop to each person'<br>

fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'nothing'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To take more breaks, have more time to finish
missing things from the other days, because I couldn't finish stuff

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'bigger room'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'NA'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know I had a really good time.'<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Always have teems of 2.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'They should make camp longer and let it be more than one week.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'make it longer,and make table groups not panters'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Table groups not partners we want more people.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'To have a little more time for the students to work. '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'let them be in a group instead of a partner'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'do not have partners'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'lucnh at 11:30'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Probably by giving the students more time to work on each project so the work can be better.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'add a video on how they create the wedsite step by step '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The place where you teach could be bigger'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i think its the fine the way it iis'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'More slots available for more people to join'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i dont know'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I would really like if the mentors could explain the process of how to do the coding in an easier way. '<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'none'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i have no idea'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'raise money such as fundraisers for more laptops '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was fine just fine.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I believe you can make this camp better by elaborating on each subject before we start it'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'science engineering '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'maybe more coding.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Maybe this camp could be two weeks so then the
first week we could do easy things and then the second week we could do
harder things.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You should likely extend the camp to 2:15, this way more students get chances to present.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'fix the pdf's; we were told to do different things than what was on the pdf's for some of the topics'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I don't know'<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I think you all could do&nbsp; more involving Robots'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'more time to work'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'to make the most out of it '<br>

job in it, like either Software development or Cyber Security.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This camp gave me a better intrest in coding and it also made me realize that coding is fun.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It was fun, although psychiatry is cooler, but the
camp was really good and would definitely hook in other students!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'i learned how to animate and code much better, how
to use sensors, and i learned that i dont like to make websites.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This camp was fun and i enjoyed learning about coding '<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thankyou.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '???????'<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'it helped me learned the diffrent types of enginering'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' It's pretty cool I guess..I liked making a website.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'coding can get boring but it reminds me it's worth it because at the end I coded something amazing.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nope, no comments.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'it was lots of fun and i learned alot too!!!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'it helped me learn more about how to code and make animations'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I still want to be either an engineer or an architect'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'it healped me understand more about coding'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '??????'&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This camp show me a lot about engineering and coding.'<br>
