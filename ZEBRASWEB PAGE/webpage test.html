I AM A LOVING AND CARING PERSON AND I DO DANCE AND TUMBLING TOO!<br>
WHEN I GET OLDER I WANT TO BE A VET BECAUSE I LIKE ALL ANIMALS, AND NEXT YEAR IS MY TENTH YEAR <br>
OF DANCE. WHEN I AM IN HIGH SCHOOL I WANT TO BE IN CHEER AND BE A FLYER.<br>
ONE OTHER THING I LIKE TO DO IS DRAW AND PAINT.<br>
